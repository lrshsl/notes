== Tuples

n-tuples are ordered sequences of n elements.

2-tuples are called ordered pairs.

== Sets

=== Power set

The set of all subsets.

Let $A = {a, b}$ then $ P(A) = {emptyset, {a}, {b}, {a, b}} $

== Cartesian product

$ A_1 crossmark A_2 crossmark ... = {(a_1, a_2, ...) | a_1 in A_1, a_2 in A_2, ...} $

== Truth set

Set with the elements from a domain $D$ for which a given predicate $P(x)$ is true.

$ { a in D | P(a) } $

== Cardinality

Number of elements in a set

Notation: $|A|$

- Power set: $P(A) = 2^(|A|)$
- $|A crossmark B| = |A| dot |B|$
- $|A union B| = |A| + |B| - |A inter B|$
